Hello again and welcome to Section 2 introducing use development tools in this section we will learn

how to use Gaede to generate code templates for our models views and controllers.

We will also take a look at the debug module.

So let's move on to the first video section configuring and use ngi.

We'll take a look at exactly what is why we want to use it and how to configure it.

As you may already be aware he implements the model view controller pattern when using an MVC based

framework.

Developers often spend a lot of time copying and pasting common code and then editing it to meet the

requirements of a specific application feature.

This process is both time consuming and error prone.

With key we can use a web based interface to quickly generate Model View and controller code that is

tailored to our needs.

Once we get GUI configured we'll go ahead and take a brief look at its features.

As you can easily imagine a tool that can generate code on the server represents a security risk in

the hands of unauthorized users.

So these authors wisely chose to require us to explicitly set some configuration options in order to

access it.

The guitar is located in the subdirectory of your site

but you'll see if we try to access it then we get a 403 forbidden error.

That's because GUI only allows requests from localhost by default but because our application is running

on a vagrant server our host and guest machines use separate IP addresses in order to allow access to

key we simply need to add the IP address of our host machine to that configuration to find your host

machine IP address.

Create a new file in the webroot called IP that HP

and echo the remote address value of the server super global If we pull this script up the browser will

see that our IP addresses 192 168.

That 56 wan.

Remember to delete this file before moving to production.

Now we simply need to add this IP address to our configuration.

Go ahead and open up web DHP and scroll down to line 59.

You'll see that this section of the config is wrapped in an IF statement that only runs if the site

is in development mode which is another layer of security so the key will be totally inaccessible in

production mode from any source.

Simply edit the Configuration section as follows.

In order to add your IP address.

Now switch back to your browser and reload.

You'll see that were greeted warmly by the magical tool that can write code for you on first glance

and you will notice that key can be used to generate models views and controllers.

It can also be used to quickly scaffold out forms modules and extensions in this course we will use

the model generator as well as the generator to generate the bulk of the code for our application.

Now you know what key is and how to set it up.

Up next we will look more closely at the process of generating model code as well as some of the key

features of models in E-2.
